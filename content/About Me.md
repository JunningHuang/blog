Hi there, it's Junning. I'm doing a PhD in [IAS](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/) , TU Darmstadt. My current research interest is to go beyond the classic conservative model-based control theoretic approaches, build up state estimators and controllers that 

- Satisfies certain performance or safety criteria, go beyond asymptotical stability;
- Deal with nonlinear, hybrid, non-smooth dynamics;

with modern geometry, optimization and machine learning tools. The ultimate goal here is to automate daily processes and to help us focusing on necessary and better decision making.

My journey of research starts at [Sensetime](https://www.sensetime.com/en), where I was doing reinforcement learning, inverse reinforcement learning. The topics include theoretical one: exploration-exploitation dilemma and application for decision making in autonomous driving. Though the research problems are interesting and my mentors are really nice, I did not learn how to properly do research and didn't find the problem that really triggers me. It was a nice experience though because I learnt one key principle from my mentor in learning everything: be honest to yourself.
