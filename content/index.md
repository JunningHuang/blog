This is Junning's digital garden, welcome! I'm a PhD student who's working in robot control, state estimation and system identification in [IAS](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/), TU Darmstadt. My current research interest is to go beyond the classic conservative model-based control theoretic approaches, build up state estimators and controllers that 

- Satisfies certain performance or safety criteria, go beyond asymptotical stability;
- Deal with nonlinear, hybrid, non-smooth dynamics;

with modern geometry, optimization and machine learning tools. The ultimate goal here is to automate daily processes in a robust and safely manner and performing intelligent decision making to assist humans.

Here are some paths you might follow to get to know more about me, my research and interests:
- [[State Estimation/index|ðŸŒ± State Estimation]]: State Estimation related content.
- [[Robotics/index|ðŸ¤– Robotics]]: Robotics related content.
- [[Thoughts/index|ðŸ§  Thoughts]]: Thoughts that I randomly ran into or pondered.
- [[Readings/index|ðŸ“– Readings]]: Notes for the non-technological readings.

If you have any thoughts or want to collaborate, feel free to drop me an email (junning.huang@ias.tu-darmstadt.de).
