This is Junning's digital garden, welcome! I'm a PhD student who's working in robot control, state estimation and system identification in [IAS](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/), TU Darmstadt. My current research interest is to go beyond the classic conservative model-based control theoretic approaches, build up state estimators and controllers that 

- Satisfies certain performance or safety criteria, go beyond asymptotical stability;
- Deal with nonlinear, hybrid, non-smooth dynamics;

with modern geometry, optimization and machine learning tools. The ultimate goal here is to automate daily processes and to help us focusing on necessary and better decision making. 

Here are some paths you might follow to get to know more about me, my research and interests:
- [[State Estimation/index|ðŸŒ± State Estimation]] State Estimation related content.
- [[content/Robotics/index|ðŸ¤– Robotics]]: Robotics related content.
- [[content/Thoughts/index|ðŸ§  Thoughts]]: Thoughts that I randomly ran into or pondered.
- [[content/Readings/index|ðŸ“– Readings]]: Notes for the non-technological readings.

If you have any thoughts or want to collaborate, feel free to drop an [email](junning.huang@ias.tu-darmstadt.de).
