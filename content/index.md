This is Junning's digital garden, welcome! I'm a PhD student who's working in robot control, state estimation and system identification in [IAS](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/), TU Darmstadt. I build this digital garden to record some notes and thoughts in my life and study.

Here are some paths you might follow to get to know more about me, my research and interests:
- [[State Estimation/index|🌱 State Estimation]]: State Estimation related content.
- [[Robotics/index|🤖 Robotics]]: Robotics related content.
- [[Thoughts/index|🧠 Thoughts]]: Thoughts that I randomly ran into or pondered.
- [[Readings/index|📖 Readings]]: Notes for the non-technological readings.

If you have any thoughts or want to collaborate, feel free to drop me an email (junning.huang@ias.tu-darmstadt.de).
