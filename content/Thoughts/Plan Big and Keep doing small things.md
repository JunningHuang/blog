Today I do reflect a bit why I didn't finish the writing for the recall of the paper Observer design for continuous systems.

First and for-most, the paper is quite dense, so if you follow the paper step by step, then it turns out would be a super huge project. The project is bigger than I think. So you either break down into several summary papers, or you just write a sketch of it and focus on the most important part of the paper.

Now I feel more and more doing research and studying is like training for mountaineering or bouldering. You need a goal that really motivates you, and then if you are matured enough, you can collaborate with people and do model predictive control with your plan and execution. But if you are not, just try to hire or to find a coach or a senior colleague, someone that have already been there and knows how to train you and inspire you to go on the track, or at least know how to handle the uncertainties. So that you can plan big, and focus on the small things that you could do right now.

I really like the answers in "https://www.zhihu.com/people/Masaki.Ryuu/answers", I feel like his value really resonates with me. Why am I want to become a creator instead of a consumer, because I really want to find the likely unique experience, research is a good way to have the extreme intellectual stimulation, the view and art that you finally craft might be a failure to reviewers, as it's most likely always the case, but the feeling that you are pushing over your boundaries and the boundaries of science is extremely rewarding. Moutaineering, other extreme sports can keep you extremely focus on yourself otherwise you would die. Only this kind of experience can make me feel alive. The process of construction and lift myself up makes me feel alive.
