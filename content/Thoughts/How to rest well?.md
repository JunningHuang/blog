This is a question I was thinking for recently. What does it mean rest well? I hope I could figure it out as soon as possible.

A typical weekends for me would be staying up very late on Friday, keep on watching some trash TV series or movies and then waked up very late at around 11:00 or 11:30 am, then go to gym and do some grocery shopping and it's already 3pm, I went to the office or lab to have a very unproductive afternoon. After that I went back home and have my dinner. Because it's really late after I finish the dinner, I always felt that I have to do something to spend my time properly, then I open another trash TV series to ruin my Sunday.

It seems that I spent a lot of time on weekends to entertain myself, but did I really enjoy a lifestyle like this? Absolutely no! Usually I felt super tired the whole day and I don't feel productive when I'm working and don't feel very relaxed and enjoy when I'm watching something. The way I spent my nights seems more like some tasks I have to finish instead of I really enjoy doing it.

I feel like to address this issue you need to be serious in entertaining and relaxing yourself as you are at work. Rest well is as challenging as working hard, you also need to focus, remove the unnecessary distractions I think. So it's better to keep things simple, such as work and life should be separate. But how to do it? I would spend a month to answer the question myself and write another post if I figure it out.
